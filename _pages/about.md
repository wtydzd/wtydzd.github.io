<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a Ph.D. candidate and research assistant in the Department of Computer Science at Texas Tech University. I am part of the research team led by Dr. Yong Chen, collaborating with experts like Dr. Alan Sill, senior scientist from Texas Tech University and Dr. Xi Wang from Southeast University. My research focuses on High-Performance Computing (HPC) and large language models on HPC.

<!-- I have published several papers at the international conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0ksyzc8AAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0ksyzc8AAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>). -->
